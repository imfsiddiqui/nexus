### 🛠️ Submitting Changes

- **Fork** the repository.
- **Clone** your fork: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nexus.git`.
- **Create a branch** for your change using following naming convention to help
  quickly identify the purpose of your changes.
  - Branch name convention: `{type}/your-branch-name`, where `{type}` is one of
    the following:
    - `build` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
    - `chore` - Maintenance tasks not affecting main code
    - `ci` - Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
    - `docs` - Documentation-only changes
    - `feat` - New features
    - `fix` - Bug fixes

    - `revert` - Reverting a previous commit
    - `style` - Code style, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
    - `test` - Adding or updating tests
  - The branch name after `{type}/` will be all in lowercase, words separated by
    dashes (`-`).
    - Example: `feat/add-login-endpoint`, `fix/typo-in-readme`
- **Make your changes** and **add tests** if applicable.
- **Commit** your changes following the
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format with emoji
  prefixes. See
